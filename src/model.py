class model(nn.Module):
    """
    Graph-based regression model with reaction-level self attention for
    reaction-yield prediction.

    Every compound of a reaction "reactants >> products" is encoded by the
    shared GNN. Only the reactants (reagents are treated as reactants), i.e. the
    compounds on the left of ">>", then attend to each other in a (multi-head)
    self-attention block; their value vectors are averaged into one reactant
    vector. The products do not take part in the attention: their GNN embeddings
    are averaged into one product vector, and the reaction vector is the
    concatenation [reactant vector, product vector].
